Introduction
============

Me and my partner like to manage our finances together. We created this application to help us keep track of our expenses and savings.

We both use separate bank accounts, but pool our money together for shared expenses. This application helps us track how much we have spent, how much we have saved, and how much we owe each other.

We grew tired of the excel spreadsheets, so I made this application.
