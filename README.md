# Balance

 Myself and my partner like to stay organised when it comes to our finances. 

 We use multiple-separate bank accounts, but pool our money and share the bills. 

 We got fed up of excel tweaking and formulas, so I made this app to help.

 # Setup

Windows:
- No sweat.. as far as I can tell.
Mac:
- Make sure to install this under your user directory - originally tried under my icloud folder but kept failing.

# Dev quickstart

1. clone the repo - to get the repo.
2. python -m venv .venv - to create venv.
3. source .venv/bin/activate - to activate venv.
4. pip install -r requirements.txt - install project requirements.

# Developer Documentation

1. Dev Quickstart (above)
2. cd docs - navigate to the docs directory
3. make html - to generate the docs
4. open _build/html/index.html - to view the docs in a browser.

 # Quick-start
